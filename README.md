# FuseBoxSD

![FuseBoxSD](images/FuseBoxSD.png)

The FuseBoxSD 3D printer is derived from the [FB2020 Plus by AxMod3DPrint](http://github.com/AxMod3DPrint/FB2020). 

Changes from the FB2020 Plus include
* Metal brackets replace printed brackets
* The carriage and idlers have been redesigned
* The printed parts for the bed have been modified to fit the heatbed
* Many of the other printed parts have been modified for M5 screws
* The controller runs Smoothieware
* A Raspberry Pi 3 is included, for OctoPi
* A complete model is provided, in Fusion 360 and STEP formats

You will need to provide a Bowden extruder. We have been using the [Belted Extruder v4 by dintid](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2527297).
